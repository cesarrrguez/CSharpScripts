# Data Types

## Data Type Conversion

Explicit conversions require a cast operator.

In addition, the destination and source variables should be compatible.

Conversion with the assistance of a helper class such as Convert enables us to convert between non-compatible types. This does not need the use of a cast operator.

## Decimal to Int

### Ceiling

Find the smallest integer, which is greater than or equal to the passed argument.

### Floor

Find the largest integer, which is less than or equal to the passed argument.

## Boxing and Unboxing

### Boxing

Boxing is the process of converting a value type to the object type or any interface type implemented by this value type. Boxing is implicit.

### Unboxing

Unboxing is the reverse of boxing. It is the process of converting a reference type to value type. Unboxing extract the value from the reference type and assign it to a value type.

Unboxing is explicit. It means we have to cast explicitly.
