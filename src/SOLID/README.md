# SOLID

## 1. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

A class should only have a single responsibility.

## 2. OCP (Open/Closed Principle)

A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## 3. LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)

Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

## 4. ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

## 5. DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)

Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
