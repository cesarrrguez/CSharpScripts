## Check For Overflow

### Checked

Block keyword that enables arithmetic overflow checking. Normally, if an integer operation exceeds the maximum or minimum value that the type can handle, the operation proceeds anyway.

## Conditional Operator

The Conditional operator provides a fast and simple way of writing if-else statements:

```
condition ? first_expression : second_expression;
```

If the condition is true, return the first expression, and if the condition is false, return the second expression.
