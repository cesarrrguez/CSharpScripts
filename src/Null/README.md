# Null

## Null Coalescing Operator

The null coalescing operator returns left-hand operand if the operand is not null, and if it is, the right-hand operand is returned. Using this operator, we can avoid Null Reference Exception, which is thrown when we try to use something that is null.

# Null Conditional Operator

The null conditional is a form of a member access operator. With a null conditional operator, the expression A?.B evaluates to B if the left operand (A) is non-null; otherwise, it evaluates to null.
