# Expression-Bodied Members

Expression body definitions let you provide a member's implementation in a very concise, readable form. You can use an expression body definition whenever the logic for any supported member, such as a method or property, consists of a single expression.

An expression body definition has the following general syntax:

```
member => expression;
```
