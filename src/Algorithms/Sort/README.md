# Sort

## Bubble Sort

Repeatedly steps through the array, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the array is repeated until the array is sorted.

## Insertion Sort

Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

## Selection Sort

The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted array, swapping it with the left most unsorted element, and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

## Merge Sort

Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).

Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

## Quick Sort

It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
